# In-Class 3 - Inheritance, Polymorphism, Mixins, and Abstract Classes

## Author



## Description

The purpose of this in-class is to learn about Inheritance, Polymorphism, Mixins, and Abstract Classes.

We will focus on the following:

Using multiple classes in a program. Make our code reusable through inheritance. Show how to abstract common things into parent classes. How to put add-on functionality into a Mixin. Why programming in the generic is better than programming in the specific.
